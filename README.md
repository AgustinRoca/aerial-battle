# aerial-battle

Sample code for Computational Thinking course hands-on project (2023 spring semester).

Skeleton code for the aerial battle game. Two agents play against each other. The goal is to shoot down the opponent's
airships. Each agent has one shot per turn. The game ends when one of the agents has no more airships left.

## Disclaimer

This code was made as a proof of concept for a hands-on project in a course. It is not meant to be a full-fledged game.
The code is not optimized for performance, and it is not guaranteed to be bug-free.

## MacOS

MacOS has issues with `matplotlib` right now. If you want to see the game board, you can run the game on a different OS,
or try to run it in a notebook.
